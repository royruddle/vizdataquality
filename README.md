# vizdataquality
This is a Python package for visualizing data quality, and includes this six-step workflow:
1. Look at your data (is anything obviously wrong?)
2. Watch out for special values
3. Is any data missing?
4. Check each variable
5. Check combinations of variables
6. Profile the cleaned data

## Documentation

## Installation

## Tutorials
The package includes notebooks that show you how to:
- Calculate a set of data quality attributes and output them to a file
- Use each type of plot
- Create a report while you investigate data quality and profile a dataset
- Apply the six-step workflow to an open parking fines dataset

After installing vizdataquality, to follow theses tutorials interactively you will need to clone or download this repository. Then start jupyter from within it:

python -m jupyter notebook notebooks
```
